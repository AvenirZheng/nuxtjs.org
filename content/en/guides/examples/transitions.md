`pages/home.vue` shows the `transition` property with a bounce transition and `pages/fun.vue` with a slide-bottom transition.

`assets/main.css` has the classes for the bounce and slide-bottom transition as well as the default page and layout transitions which are applied to pages that do not have the transition property set.
